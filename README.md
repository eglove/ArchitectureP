ArchitectureP
=============

Project Phase 1

Design Verilog module and testbench for:

2-to-1 multiplexor (MUX)
Instruction memory (IMEM)
Data memory (DMEM)
Register file containing 32 registers (RFILE)
Sign-extension unit (SIGNEXT)
These components are as described in the single cycle datapath of MIPS.

The goal of the project is to design a single cycle processor that supports a small subset of MIPS instruction set architecture. The subset will be provided in phase II of the project where you need to combine the above components to support the instructions.

This projects is to be done in a group of four. One member from each group should email me the name of all group members by Monday, Oct 27th. Let me know if you are unable to form a group. Each group is required to set up a demo date with me on or before Friday, Nov 14th.
